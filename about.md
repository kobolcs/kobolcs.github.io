## Helping Tech Teams Deliver Software with Confidence
{: .section-light}

In today’s world of rapid releases, continuous delivery, and growing complexity, software teams face a tough challenge:
**How do you maintain speed without sacrificing quality?**

That’s where I come in.

I help SaaS, digital product, and tech-driven teams **build and scale test automation solutions** that reduce risk, improve quality, and support fast, reliable releases.

**I bridge the gap** between the desire for automation and the reality of what it takes to implement frameworks that work — technically, strategically, and within your team’s workflow.

## My Story
{: .section-light}

My technology career began in 1998 as a junior developer. Over time, I gained hands-on experience in IT systems, budgeting and reporting for major institutions, and enterprise program management at Dell — leading multi-language portal and reporting initiatives across EMEA.

For the past 13 years, I’ve specialized in test automation and quality assurance, helping teams balance speed and quality in demanding release environments.

Now, as an independent consultant, I bring this experience to tech-driven companies needing expert guidance in test automation, QA strategy, and team maturity.

## My Philosophy {#philosophy}
{: .section-light}

**Test automation should serve business goals, not just technical checklists.**

**My approach is built on three principles:**

- **Business-Aligned Testing:** Testing strategies must reduce risk and support product growth.
- **Pragmatic Automation:** Solutions must be maintainable, scalable, and integrated into real-world workflows.
- **Collaborative Partnership:** I work closely with developers, QA leads, and engineering managers to ensure the solutions fit both technical and team cultures.

> **Bottom line:** I build solutions that empower teams to deliver software confidently at speed.
