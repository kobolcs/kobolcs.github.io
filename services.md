# AI-Driven Test Automation (R&D)

I'm actively researching the use of AI and machine learning tools to enhance automated testing:

- **Self-healing test automation frameworks**
- **AI-assisted test generation and maintenance**
- **Test data optimization using AI models**

While I am not currently offering this as a full production service, I'm open to **pilot projects** and **collaborative R&D** with early adopters.

## Interested in exploring AI in your testing strategy?

# Blockchain Testing (Coming Soon)

I'm currently expanding into **automated testing for Web3 projects**, including:

- **Smart contract testing**
- **Automated dApp user journey testing**
- **Security and compliance test strategies**

If you're developing a **pilot project** or would like to collaborate, I'd love to hear from you.
